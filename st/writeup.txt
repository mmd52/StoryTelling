A Government is made by the people which is used to serve the people, However that is not the case anymore.

News used to be dull and boring, now its entertaining due to distortion of facts.

The impact of both these things
1) Wrong interpretations of Countries, Race, Religion
2) Unwanted increase of hate crimes amongst the extrimist uneducated population

But what we can do to stop this
1) Stop absorbing news from social media and biased news firms
2) Stop forwarding incorrect posts, your like is not going to stop a war in Syria -> So seriously grow up
3) Read about the world a bit more (Usefull tip : If you found it a tad bit boring , its true)
4) Stop judging a book by its cover. Meet people understand their point of view and any difficulty they may have faced before jumping to conclusions and making stupid decisions.
